Ethical issues: 
	1.	1.5 Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artifacts. If I were to 			add my feature to the YO application, I would need to give credit to the original creator of the YO application.
	2.	1.7 Honor confidentiality. In order to add my feature to the YO application, I would need access to the source code. 			Assuming this code has some trade secret, it is my responsibility to make sure I do not disclose anything.
	3.	1.6 Respect privacy. While adding my feature to YO, I would need to make sure the application itself along with my 			function respects the privacy of the user, making sure that either do not send or store any personal data that the user 		does not want me to.
Legal issues regarding China:
	1.	Under the Cybersecurity Law, the YO application must obtain the consent of an individual for the collection and use of 			their personal information. 
	2.	Under Chinese law, there are no limitations or restrictions on the amount of time user data can be stored. If the YO 			application were to set a time on how long it stores data, the user must be informed when the data will expire, and the 		data MUST be deleted no later than that date.
	3.	Under the Cybersecurity Law, If the YO application is collecting user information, the user must be informed of the 			purpose, manner, and scope for the collection, and obtain consent for the collection. 
Professional Issues:
	1.	2.1 Strive to achieve high quality in both the processes and products of professional work. While working on thefunction 		for YO, I should make sure it works perfectly. If I deploy it with a faulty function, that looks bad on the application.
	2.	2.3 Know and respect existing rules pertaining to professional work. Some legal issue on storing data may ariseregarding 		some function of the application. I must respect those laws.
	3.	2.4 Accept and provide appropriate professional review. There is the possibility that my function may not work correctly 		on the YO application. I must accept professional review before deploying to ensure whatever I add to the application 			works correctly.
